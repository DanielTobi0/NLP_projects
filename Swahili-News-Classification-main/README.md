# Swahili-News-Classification
First place solution (now second place recently). <br> <br>
The model used was [flax-community/bert-swahili-news-classification](flax-community/bert-swahili-news-classification), which was fine-tunned on the Bert model, using the [flax-community/swahili-safi dataset](flax-community/bert-base-uncased-swahili), on HuggingFace.
